How does diff help

Diff helps find mistakes that may be leading to bugs
Diff is a quick way to check your incremental work
Diff is a fast mechanism for sifting through larger files

How could having access to history make me more efficient

It allows me to trace back through changes
I can use history to get back to the last working version
I won't accidentally lose stuff

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pro:
Fits to my needs
Can control the right size of change
Only I know if it's commit worthy

Cons:
I can forget
I can lose alot by not doing it
I might make a big change very hard to merge in


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Depends on the use case.  Coding requires simultaneous changes across files whereas docs are a one and done use case

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log to help me find a summary of the different changes
diff to help me look at those changes in detail


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I always know I can work my way back and try again

How Do You Want to Use Git?

To keep tracking my changes as I do harder projects
To act as my core repository
