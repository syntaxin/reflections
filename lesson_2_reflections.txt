What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It lets Git know that it's a directory that will start needing version control
It is the start of tracking versions for new projects and code

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's different in that it's a parking lot for things I will want to commit
It lets me control the level and size of that commit in a larger directory
it helps me when I'm working on multiple tasks to narrow my commits


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

when working in multiple tasks, I can choose which files to update
I can use it to stage multiple commits each with its own set of files
