When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Sharing a project
Collaborating across multiple people
Using multiple computers and work stations
Backup as the source of truth for a project
Local machine disasters


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There could be multiple changes happening to the origin
I may have multiple changes happening on my local
I may not want new changes yet as it could conflict with what I'm trying to do
