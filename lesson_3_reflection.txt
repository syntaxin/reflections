When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Sharing a project
Collaborating across multiple people
Using multiple computers and work stations
Backup as the source of truth for a project
Local machine disasters


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There could be multiple changes happening to the origin
I may have multiple changes happening on my local
I may not want new changes yet as it could conflict with what I'm trying to do

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks create a new origin code base for people to collaborate on
Clones are copies of an origin that could be in multiple states of difference
Branches are specific variations of the source

Forks to create a new large project that is intended to take to original in a new direction
Clone to get different copies onto my space for creating changes
Branches to represent the changes on my clone


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

knowing what changes have been made
knowing how to reverse out my state
knowing how the remote has been updated


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I'd be able to have multiple people working on a project and we can work on different things at the same time. 
Harder would be keeping us all in sync in terms of what the correct version of the code is
Harder would be managing the changes as someone has to deal with PRs and Merge Conflicts
